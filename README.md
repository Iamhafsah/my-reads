My Reads App

This is a book shelf/library app.
You can search for books in the search bar, and group them in various shelves. 
If the book term which you searched for does not show up, feel free to go through the #SEARCH_TERMS.md file and search for a term contained there.



To start developing:

run npm install to install the dependencies.

run npm start.
